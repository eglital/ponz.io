# Ponz.io
by Egle Libby

Once a user signs up with Ponz.io they are presented with their referral link. Their friend can follow this link to a custom signup form. Once the friend signs up, the original user is awarded 40 Ponz points. When their friend, in turn, signs up another Ponvert, the original user receives 20 Ponz points. This pattern continues down the chain of opportunity forever, with the amount of rewarded Ponz points decreasing in the following pattern: 40, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1.
Each user can spend their points in small The Ponz Shoppe.

To start using sign up, and share your referral link! If you want to see it in test mode, sign up with "test@test.com" and "test", email and password respectively.
